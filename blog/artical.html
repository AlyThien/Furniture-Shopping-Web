            The project began with a clear challenge: making highly technical
            content intuitive — opening systems, finishes, options, materials.
            We created a clear visual hierarchy, a lightweight interface, and a
            modular navigation logic that guides users without overwhelming
            them.

            We started with structure: a fully modular, configurable system that
            allows the Impronta team to build and update content independently,
            while maintaining consistency and precision. This approach enabled
            us to manage a large amount of information and shape it into an
            essential digital narrative. Every section, every component has a
            clear purpose. Nothing is ornamental, nothing is random. Even the
            animations — subtle, purposeful, never intrusive — follow this
            logic: not made to impress, but to guide. The result is a website
            that doesn't show off — it shows method.

            For animations, we used GSAP, specifically the Flip and SplitText
            plugins, to achieve smooth transitions and refined
            micro-interactions.
